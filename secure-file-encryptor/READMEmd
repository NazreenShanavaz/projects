# 🔐 Secure File Encryptor (Python)

A simple and secure tool to **encrypt and decrypt any file** (text, images, PDFs, docs, etc.) using strong cryptography.  
This protects your data from unauthorized access — only someone with the secret key can decrypt the files.

---

## ✅ Features
✔ Generate a secure encryption key  
✔ Encrypt any file into a protected `.enc` format  
✔ Decrypt encrypted files back to original  
✔ Automatic logging of encryption/decryption actions  
✔ Works for all file types  
✔ Beginner-friendly menu interface

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Requirements
Make sure Python is installed, then run:

pip install cryptography

yaml
Copy code

---

### 2️⃣ Run the Tool

python main.py

css
Copy code

You will see a menu:

===== Secure File Encryptor =====

Generate Encryption Key

Encrypt a File

Decrypt a File

Exit

yaml
Copy code

### ✅ Example Usage

#### ✅ Encrypt a file
- Choose option **2**
- Enter path:  
samples/test.txt

cpp
Copy code
- A new file will be created:
samples/test.txt.enc

markdown
Copy code

#### ✅ Decrypt a file
- Choose option **3**
- Enter:
samples/test.txt.enc

yaml
Copy code
- Original file is restored

---

## 📜 Logging
All actions are saved in:
logs/actions.log

makefile
Copy code

Example:
ENCRYPTED | test.txt -> test.txt.enc
DECRYPTED | test.txt.enc -> test.txt

yaml
Copy code

## 🔒 How it Works (Simple Explanation)

- The program generates a **secret key**
- This key scrambles the file into unreadable data (`.enc`)
- The same key is needed to decrypt and restore the file  
- Without the key, the content cannot be recovered

This uses `Fernet` encryption from the `cryptography` library — secure, reliable, and used in real-world applications.
